# Visualization Tool

## Overview

The Visualization Tool is designed to provide an interactive platform for visualizing data insights and analytics. This tool aims to simplify the process of data exploration and presentation, enabling users to derive meaningful conclusions from their datasets through intuitive visual representations.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Create dynamic dashboards that allow users to filter and manipulate data in real-time.
- **Custom Visualizations**: Support for various types of visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and more.
- **Text Processing**: Advanced text processing capabilities to analyze and visualize textual data effectively.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive web interface that makes it easy for users of all skill levels to navigate and utilize the tool.
- **Model Integration**: Seamlessly integrate machine learning models to enhance data analysis and predictions.

## Installation

To set up the Visualization Tool locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SP4567/Visualization_tool.git
   cd Visualization_tool
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start visualizing your data by following these steps:

1. **Upload Your Dataset**: Use the upload feature to import your CSV or text files.
2. **Select Visualization Type**: Choose the type of visualization you want to create from the dashboard.
3. **Customize Your Visualization**: Adjust parameters such as colors, labels, and axes to fit your needs.
4. **Save and Export**: Save your visualizations or export them for use in reports or presentations.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following key files:

- `app.py`: The main application file that initializes the server and handles routing.
- `dashboard.py`: Contains the logic for rendering the interactive dashboard.
- `model_handler.py`: Manages the loading and execution of machine learning models.
- `text_processing.py`: Implements functions for processing and analyzing text data.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used throughout the application.
- `visualization.py`: Core functions for generating visualizations.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for the web interface.
- `static/`: Directory for static files like CSS and JavaScript.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required to run the application.
- `_redirects.txt`, `netlify.toml`: Configuration files for deployment on Netlify.
